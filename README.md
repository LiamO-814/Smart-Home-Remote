# Smart-Home-Remote
Log and File for 3D Printed Remote enclosure


This project has taken multiple iterations including a a full "back-to-the-drawing-board" moment, that, so far, seems to have been for the best. Much of this project was also developing my 3D Design and CAD skills, so I think my comfort and skill level shows throughout iterations of the project.

## Outline

The general outline of this project can be summarized in the following circuit:

Fritzing is a bit limited in terms of parts, so I had to use some substitutes. 

I am using a [USB Charge Controller with a TP4056 Charge Controller](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256804241424963.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.17.59e274ddH2cvsc&gatewayAdapt=glo2usa):

The microcontroller is a [ESP32-C3 Zero Development Board from Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-c3-zero.htm):
