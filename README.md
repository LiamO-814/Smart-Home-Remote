# Smart-Home-Remote
Log and File for 3D Printed Remote enclosure


This project has taken multiple iterations including a a full "back-to-the-drawing-board" moment, that, so far, seems to have been for the best. Much of this project was also developing my 3D Design and CAD skills, so I think my comfort and skill level shows throughout iterations of the project.
